# Personal Portfolio

This is the repository for my **personal portfolio website**, built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The project showcases my projects, skills, and contact information in a modern and responsive way.

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for fast and responsive styling.
- **Vite** / **Create React App**: Build and bundling tool (depending on your setup).
- **React Router**: For navigation between internal pages (Home, About, Contact, etc.).
